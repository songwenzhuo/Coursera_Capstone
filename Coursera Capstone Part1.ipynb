    "A car accident may be caused by a variety of reasons, and in some cases it may cause casualties, such as extreme weather and poor road conditions. If people can estimate the probability or severity of a car accident in advance by learning some information, they will drive more carefully, thereby reducing the probability and loss of accidents.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The main people who would be interested in this project are some traffic polices, because to reduce accidents and loss, they need to reasonably arrange the traffic flow according to the forecast. Besides, hospitals also need such systems to prepare for accidents rescue in advance, and drivers can drive more carefully with the prediction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this project, the goal is to **build a model which can predict the severity of an accident**.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "According to personal experience, there are several reasons for car accidents.  \n",
    " - **Road conditions**. Sometimes, the condition is too bad, which causes driving difficult; or the road conditions are good, which makes drivers careless to drive.\n",
    " - **Light conditions**. On roads with poor visibility, like night, the driver may not be able to accurately and timely judge the situation, which can cause a car accident.\n",
    " - **Extreme weather**. In some extreme weather, driving is very dangerous.\n",
    " - **Bad driving habits**. Some drivers have bad driving habits, like to play with their mobile phones while driving and high speed, which may cause a car accident.\n",
    " - **Drunk/drug driving**. When the driver is in an abnormal state, it is extremely prone to car accidents.\n",
    " - **Bicycles/pedestrians**. If the accident is related with bicycles or pedestrians, it will make more loss and even casualties.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In the training dataset, there are many features, some of which are about the above discussion. Therefore, by analzing important features and using a supervised learning algorithm, it can build a model to predict the severity of an accident to some degree."
